     <h3>Where can I learn about types of mental health treatment?</h3>
     <p>Mental health conditions are often treated with medication, therapy or a combination of the two.  However, there are many different types of treatment available, including Complementary & Alternative Treatments, self-help plans, and peer support. Treatments are very personal and should be discussed by the person with the mental health conditions and his or her team.</div>

     <h3>What causes mental illness?    </h3>
     <p>Although the exact source of mental illness is not known, research points to a mix of genetic, biological, psychosocial, and environmental factors as being the root of most conditions.

      Since this combination of causes is complex, there is no sure way to prevent mental illness. However, you can reduce your risk by practicing self-care, seeking help when you need it, and paying attention to early warning signs. </p>     </div>

     <h3>ARE HOMEOPATHIC MEDICINES SAFE? </h3>
     <p>The small doses used in homeopathic medicines make them extremely safe. Of course, it is important to know how to prescribe the medicines. The book I co-authored with Dr. Stephen Cummings, Everybody’s Guide to Homeopathic Medicines (Jeremy Tarcher/Putnam, 2004) provides the step-by-step information on how to use the medicines and when it is necessary to seek medical care.

        The homeopathic medicines are officially recognized by the F.D.A. as “over-the-counter drugs” and thus any person can order them without a prescription. Because they are recognized as drugs, their manufacture is regulated by the F.D.A. to assure consumers that they are getting what they ordered.</p>
